##  1.1 FOCUS AREA : Experimentation
### 1.2 About the Experiment :
Any basic logic gate can be constructed using the universal gates viz. the NAND & NOR gates.  This experiment involves combination of universal gates viz. NAND & NOR gates to design a 2:1 Mux. It provides the user the choice to build 2:1 Mux using either NAND gates only or NOR gates only. This method ensures the use of only one-type of gates for the entire design.
