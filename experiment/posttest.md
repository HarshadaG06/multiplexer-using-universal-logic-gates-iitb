## <b> Post-test</b>
#### Please attempt the following questions

<pre>
1) A 2:1 Mux using basic logic gates can be converted into a 2:1 Mux using only NAND gates, if:
    a. AND gates are replaced by NAND gates.
    <b>b. AND & OR gates replaced by NAND gates & NOT gate replaced by a NAND gate with both inputs tied together as single input.</b>
    c. OR gate is replaced by NAND gate.
    d. Both AND & OR gates are replaced by NAND gates.



2) To build a 2:1 using NAND gates (without enable), how many NAND gates are required?
a. 3
<b>b. 4</b>
c.5
d.6


3) To build a 2:1 using NOR gates (without enable), how many NOR gates are required?
a.5
b.7
<b>c.9</b>
d.11

    
4) Design, construct and verify a 2:1 Mux using NAND gates only. Get the simulation results evaluated from your faculty.

5) Implement 2:1 mux using only NOR gates. Use simulator to verify the result.
