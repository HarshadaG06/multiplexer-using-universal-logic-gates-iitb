<b>Simulation Screen 1: Option - To select universal gate to build 2:1 multiplexer</b><br>
1. Choose between the NAND and NOR gate for the experiment.
2. Click on the gate of your choice.
3. Click on "NEXT STAGE".

<b>Simulation Screen 2: To fill the Truth table for chosen gate</b><br>
1. Select appropriate options from the drop down menu and fill the truth table.
2. Click submit.
3. If incorrect try again.
4. If correct, proceed to the next step. Click Next.<br>
<b>Simulation Screen 3: Simulator Scene - To design, construct and verify the operation of a 2:1 multiplexer using universal logic gate.
</b>
Assume the enable input is activated (i.e. it is already set to zero)
<b>General instructions:</b>
1.	 Click on the digital switch and click on the canvas.
2.	Repeat step 1 for three inputs.
3.	Click on the NAND/NOR symbol and then on the canvas at an appropriate position on the canvas. 
4.	Repeat for the placement of all NAND/NOR gates.
5.	 Place the Y connector on canvas wherever one to many connections are expected.
6.	Use the connection tabs and make the necessary connections.
7.	 Connect the outputs to the LED.
8.	Simulate and verify the circuit.
